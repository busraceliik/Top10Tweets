# Top10Tweets

Bahcesehir University 2018 - 2019 CMP2003 Data Structures and Algorithms (C++) Term Project

You are expected to write a c++ console application which reads a text file that consists of  tweets 
and then print the top 10 most frequent words in the tweets.

The project consists of two parts. 

A. Implementation of data structure. This will be a proper C++ class. You must be able to create many instances of this class (You should not use third party libraries including C++ STL, Boost etc. ). However you can use, iostream, ctime, fstream, string like IO and string related
classes.

B. The main program itself. Your program must calculate the elapsed time starting from reading 
tweet file to the end of the printing top 10 words (The program should not include the Stop Words). There is no need to ask user input.
